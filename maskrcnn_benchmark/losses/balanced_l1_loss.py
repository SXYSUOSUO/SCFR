    Please see the `Libra R-CNN <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.02701.pdf>`_

    Args:
        pred (torch.Tensor): The prediction with shape (N, 4).
        target (torch.Tensor): The learning target of the prediction with
            shape (N, 4).
        beta (float): The loss is a piecewise function of prediction and target
            and ``beta`` serves as a threshold for the difference between the
            prediction and target. Defaults to 1.0.
        alpha (float): The denominator ``alpha`` in the balanced L1 loss.
            Defaults to 0.5.
        gamma (float): The ``gamma`` in the balanced L1 loss.
            Defaults to 1.5.
        reduction (str, optional): The method that reduces the loss to a
            scalar. Options are "none", "mean" and "sum".

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: The calculated loss
